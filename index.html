        <p>Flamingos are large birds that are identifiable by their long necks, sticklike legs and pink or reddish feathers. Flamingos embody the saying "you are what you eat." The pink and reddish colors of a flamingo's feathers come from eating pigments found in algae and invertebrates.</p>
       
        <h3>Fun Facts about Flamingos</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>There are six distinct speciesof flamingo, but it takes a trained eye to distinguish them.</li>
            <li>Adult flamingos are four to five feet tall, but only weigh between four and eight pounds.</li>
            <li>Flamingos feed by stirring up mud with their feet. Then they reach down and scoop up a beakful of mud and water. Their beaks are designed to strain animals out of the mud, and the muddy water is expelled. This happens as the flamingoâ€™s head is upside-down.</li>
            <li>The American flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber) is the only flamingo species native to North America, but is rarely seen in the United States anymore.</li>
            <li>The color pink comes from beta-carotene in the crustaceans and plankton that flamingos eat. Zoo flamingos will turn white if their diet is not supplemented with live shrimp or flamingo chow containing carotenoid pigments.</li>
            <li>Flamingos flock in groups of up to several hundred birds. They often perform their mating displays together, like this flamingo flamenco.</li>
            <li>Flamingo chicks are born with grey and white feathers. They do not turn pink for a year or two.</li>
            <li>Plastic lawn flamingos (Phoenicopterus plasticus) are an American cultural icon that was introduced in 1957 by artist Don Featherstone.</li>
